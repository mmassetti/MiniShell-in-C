# MiniShell-in-C
MiniShell impemented in C. Two versions: For Unix and for Windows.

Project made for the subject "Sistemas Operativos", for the degree "Ingenieria en Sistemas de Software" at Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahia Blanca, Argentina. This project is part of a larger project that involves processes, synchronization, threads, semaphores and other Operating Systems concepts.

The basic idea for the MiniShell is
1) reading from console 
2) parsing the input to get the name of the file and the name of the arguments if exists
3) executing the code

We decided to implement only built-in and simple commands and not to use the fork() command as it wasn't required or necessary for this project.
